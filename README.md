# Battleship

[Live Site](https://dayo-akinsola.github.io/Battleship/)

A program I made based on the game Battleship where you play against the computer to see who can sink their opponent's ships faster.

For this project I took a TDD approach using Jest. Ultimately, this approach was beneficial since it helpd me to create functions with a clear single purpose and have confidence in the correctness of the game logic without relying on the UI.

## Features

* AI controlled by an algorithm that makes logical decisions after hitting a ship without having access to information the human player would not have.
* Ships can be rotated hortizontally or vertically.
* Users can select ships by dragging and dropping.
